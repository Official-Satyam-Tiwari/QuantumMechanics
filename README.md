Using Scilab for solving the following problems based on Quantum Mechanics.


1. Solve the s-wave Schrodinger equation for the ground state and the first excited state of the hydrogen atom:
where m is the reduced mass of the electron. Obtain the energy eigenvalues and plot the corresponding wavefunctions. Remember that the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom is ≈ -13.6 eV. Take e = 3.795 (eVÅ)1/2, ħc = 1973 (eVÅ) and m = 0.511x106 eV/c2.


2. Solve the s-wave radial Schrodinger equation for an atom:
where m is the reduced mass of the system (which can be chosen to be the mass of an electron), for the screened coulomb potential
Find the energy (in eV) of the ground state of the atom to an accuracy of three significant digits. Also, plot the corresponding wavefunction. Take e = 3.795 (eVÅ)1/2, m = 0.511x106 eV/c2, and a = 3 Å, 5 Å, 7 Å. In these units ħc = 1973 (eVÅ). The ground state energy is expected to be above -12 eV in all three cases.


3. Solve the s-wave radial Schrodinger equation for a particle of mass m: For an harmonic oscillator potential for the ground state energy (in MeV) of particle to an accuracy of three significant digits. Also, plot the corresponding wave function. Choose m = 940 MeV/c2, k = 100 MeV fm-2, b = 0, 10, 30 MeV fm-3. In these units, cħ = 197.3 MeV fm. The ground state energy is expected to lie between 90 and 110 MeV for all three cases.


4. Solve the s-wave radial Schrodinger equation for the vibrations of hydrogen molecule:
Where μ is the reduced mass of the two-atom system for the Morse potential
Find the lowest vibrational energy (in MeV) of the molecule to an accuracy of three significant digits. Also plot the corresponding wave function.
Take: m = 940x106 eV/c2, D = 0.755501 eV, α = 1.44, r0 = 0.131349 Å
